The seasons are stored in the database. This requires you to run a ./manage.py syncdb upaon installation. 

Configurable season parameters are name, color to use, start date, end date, and about text. The can be configured
in the django backend.

Additionally a set of predifined season are available in defualts.py. These are the Northern Hemisphere four
seasons, Summer, Spring, Winter, and Fall. They start and stop on the soltices and equinoxes.

2. Copy the seasons folder to you django project folder (where your other apps are).

3. In settings.py add 'seasons' to your INSTALLED_APPS list.

5. [Optional] Load the defaults seasons. In the django python shell run:
    from seasons.defualts import *
    load_seasons()
